# Services


With version 0.7, JupyterHub adds support for 'Services'.


## JupyterHub's definition of a Service

When working with JupyterHub, a Service is defined as a process that interacts
with the Hub's REST API. A Service may perform a specialized action or
specific task. For example, each of these tasks can be a unique Service:

- shutting down individuals' single user notebook servers that have been idle
  for some time
- registering additional web servers which should use the Hub's authentication
  and be served behind the Hub's proxy.

Two main characteristics help define a Service:

1. Is the *Service* **managed** by JupyterHub?
2. Does the *Service* have a web server that should be added to the proxy's 
   table?

Currently, a Service may be either a 'Hub-Managed Service' which is managed by
JupyterHub, or an 'Externally-Managed Service' which runs its own web server and
communicates operation instructions via the Hub's API.

### Properties of a Service

If a `command` is specified for launching the Service, the Service will be
started and managed by the Hub.

If a `url` is specified for where the Service runs its own web server,
JupyterHub will add the Service to the Hub's proxy at 
`/service/:service-name`.

## Hub-Managed Service

If a Service is started by the Hub and the Hub is responsible for the
Service's actions, the Service is referred to as a **Hub-Managed Service** of 
JupyterHub. Hub-Managed Services can only be a local subprocesses of the Hub. The
Hub will take care of starting these processes and restarting them if they
stop.

While Hub-Managed Services share some similarities with notebook Spawners,
there are no plans for Hub-Managed Services to support the same spawning
abstractions as a notebook Spawner. If you wish to run Services in
Docker or other deployment environments, the Service can be registered as an
Externally-Managed Service, as described below.

### Launching a Hub-Managed Service

A Hub-Managed Service is characterized by its specified `command` for launching
the Service. For example, the configuration of a 'cull idle' notebook server
Hub-Managed Service would include the Service name, admin permissions, and the
`command` to launch the Service which will cull idle servers after a timeout
interval:

```python
c.JupyterHub.services = [
    {
        'name': 'cull-idle',
        'admin': True,
        'command': ['python', '/path/to/cull-idle.py', '--timeout']
    }
]
```


In addition to the `command` to launch the Service, a Hub-Managed Service may also
be configured with additional optional parameters, which describe the
environment needed to start the process:

- `env: dict` additional environment variables for the Service.
- `user: str` name of the user to run the server as if different from the Hub.
   Requires Hub to be root.
- `cwd: path` directory in which to run the Service, if different from the 
   Hub directory.

The Hub will pass the following environment variables to launch the Service:

```
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_NAME:   The name of the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN:      API token assigned to the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_URL:        URL for the JupyterHub API (default, http://127.0.0.1:8080/hub/api)
JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL:       Base URL of the Hub (https://mydomain[:port]/)
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX: URL path prefix of this service (/services/:service-name/)
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_URL:    Local URL where the service is expected to be listening.
                           Only for proxied web services.
```

For the previous example, these environment variables would be passed when
starting the 'cull idle' Service:

```
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_NAME: 'cull-idle'
JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN: API token assigned to the service
JUPYTERHUB_API_URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/hub/api
JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL: https://mydomain[:port]
JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX: /services/cull-idle/
```

## Externally-Managed Services

To meet your specific use case needs, you may use your own service management
tools, such as Docker or systemd, to manage a JupyterHub Service.
These Externally-Managed Services, unlike Hub-Managed Services, are not subprocesses of
the Hub. You must tell JupyterHub which API token the Externally-Managed Service is
using to perform its API requests. Each Externally-Managed Service will need a unique
API token because the Hub authenticates each API request and the API token is
used to identify the originating Service or user.

A configuration example of an Externally-Managed Service with admin access and running its
own web server is:

```python
c.JupyterHub.services = [
    {
        'name': 'my-web-service',
        'url': 'https://10.0.1.1:1984',
        'api_token': 'super-secret',
    }
]
```

In this case, the `url` field will be passed along to the service as `JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_URL`.


## Writing your own services

When writing your own services, you have a few decisions to make (in addition to what your service does!):

1. Does my service need a public URL?
2. Do I want JupyterHub to start/stop the service?
3. Does my service need to authenticate users?

When a service is managed by JupyterHub,
the Hub will pass the necessary information to the service via environment variables described above.
To make your service most flexible, you can use these same environment variables,
whether your service is managed by the Hub or not.

When a service is managed by JupyterHub,
the Hub will define the environment variables, as described above,
and pass the information as needed to the service.
A flexible service, whether managed by the Hub or not,
can make use of these same environment variables.

When you run a service that has a url, it will be accessible under a `/services/` prefix, such as `https://myhub.horse/services/my-service/`.
For your service to route proxied requests properly, it must take `JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX` into account when routing requests.
For example, a web service would normally service its root handler at `'/'`,
but the proxied service would need to serve `JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX + '/'`.


### Authenticating with the Hub

JupyterHub 0.7 introduces some utilities for using the Hub's authentication mechanism to govern access to your service.
When a user logs into JupyterHub, the Hub sets a cookie (`jupyterhub-services`).
The service can use this cookie to authenticate requests.

JupyterHub ships with a reference implementation of Hub authentication that can be used by services.
You may go beyond this reference implementation and create custom hub-authenticating clients and services.
We describe the process below.

The reference, or base, implementation is the [`HubAuth`][HubAuth] class,
which implements the requests to the Hub.

To use HubAuth, you must set the `.api_token`, either programmatically when constructing the class,
or via the `JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

Most of the logic for authentication implementation is found in the [`HubAuth.user_for_cookie`][user_for_cookie] method,
which makes a request of the Hub, and returns:

- None, if no user could be identified
- a dict of the following form:

  ```python
  {
    "name": "username",
    "groups": ["list", "of", "groups"],
    "admin": False, # or True
  }
  ```

You are then free to use that user information to take appropriate action.

HubAuth also caches the Hub responses for a number of seconds,
configurable by the `cookie_cache_max_age`` setting (default: five minutes).

#### Flask Example

For example, you have a Flask service that returns information about a user.
JupyterHub's HubAuth class can be used to authenticate requests to the Flask service.
See the `service-whoami-flask` example in the JupyterHub repo for more details.

```python
from functools import wraps
import json
import os
from urllib.parse import quote

from flask import Flask, redirect, request, Response

from jupyterhub.services.auth import HubAuth

prefix = os.environ.get('JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX', '/')

auth = HubAuth(
    api_token=os.environ['JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN'],
    cookie_cache_max_age=60,
)

app = Flask(__name__)


def authenticated(f):
    """Decorator for authenticating with the Hub"""
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        cookie = request.cookies.get(auth.cookie_name)
        if cookie:
            user = auth.user_for_cookie(cookie)
        else:
            user = None
        if user:
            return f(user, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            # redirect to login url on failed auth
            return redirect(auth.login_url + '?next=%s' % quote(request.path))
    return decorated


@app.route(prefix + '/')
@authenticated
def whoami(user):
    return Response(
        json.dumps(user, indent=1, sort_keys=True),
        mimetype='application/json',
        )
```


#### Authenticating tornado services with JupyterHub

Since most Jupyter services are written with tornado,
we include a mixin class, [`HubAuthenticated`][HubAuthenticated],
for quickly authenticating your own tornado services with JupyterHub.

Tornado's `@web.authenticated` method calls a Handler's `.get_current_user` method
to identify the user. Mixing in `HubAuthenticated` defines `get_current_user` to use HubAuth.
If you want to configure the HubAuth instance beyond the default, you'll want to define an `initialize` method, such as:

```python
class MyHandler(HubAuthenticated, web.RequestHandler):
    hub_users = {'inara', 'mal'}

    def initialize(self, hub_auth):
        self.hub_auth = hub_auth

    @web.authenticated
    def get(self):
        ...
```


The HubAuth will automatically load the desired configuration from the service environment variables.

If you want to limit user access, you can whitelist users through either the `.hub_users` attribute or `.hub_groups`.
These are sets that check against the username and user group list, respectively.
If a user matches neither the user list nor the group list, they will not be allowed access.
If both are left undefined, then any user will be allowed.


#### Implementing your own Authentication with JupyterHub

If you don't want to use the reference implementation
(e.g. you find the implementation a poor fit for your Flask app),
you can implement authentication via the Hub yourself.
We recommend looking at the [`HubAuth`][HubAuth] class implementation for reference,
and taking note of the following process:

1. retrieve the cookie `jupyterhub-services` from the request.
2. Make an API request `GET /hub/api/authorizations/cookie/jupyterhub-services/cookie-value`,
    where cookie-value is the url-encoded value of the `jupyterhub-services` cookie.
    This request must be authenticated with a Hub API token in the `Authorization` header.
    For example, with [requests][]:
    
    ```python
    r = requests.get(
        '/'/join((["http://127.0.0.1:8081/hub/api",
                   "authorizations/cookie/jupyterhub-services",
                   quote(encrypted_cookie, safe=''),
        ]),
        headers = {
            'Authorization' : 'token %s' % api_token,
        },
    )
    r.raise_for_status()
    user = r.json()
    ```

3. On success, the reply will be a JSON model describing the user:

   ```json
   { 
     "name": "inara",
     "groups": ["serenity", "guild"],
     
   }
   ```
